The best way to place the LCD 7-Segment Display and the Teensy 3.2 is to buy one 40-position header (it's the cheapest option, about $0.50) and snap it apart into the sections you need.

The Teensy 3.2 can be bought from OSH Park at checkout, or from <a href="http://pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html">PJRC</a>.
